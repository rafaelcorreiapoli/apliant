            Today, in large factories, a lot of money is lost due to processes that injured employees move against the company, alleging that it not provide the personal protective equipment suitable for their tasks. Most often , these claims are based only because the company does not have a control and management system . In addition , much time is spent on the production line between the comings and goings of the workers to the warehouse to get their equipment.

            The bornscale along with the EHS engineering team has developed a robust dispenser machine, where employees authenticate through facial recognition and choose which equipment need. The software communicates with the machine motors through the serial port , which dispenses the product and , in addition, communicates the servers of such occurrence , recording who withdrew , which removed and when. Through the web panel , the manager can map the engines and products stocked in the machine, control your inventory system , record your employees to consult their biometrics and withdrawal histories. Everything happens in real time.
